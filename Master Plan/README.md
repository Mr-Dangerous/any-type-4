# Space Fleet Combat - Deck Building Card Game

A deck-building card game built with Godot 4.5 where you deploy ships, manage resources, and battle enemies in tactical combat.

## Game Overview

Space Fleet Combat is a Slay the Spire-inspired deck-building game where you:
- Deploy ships (Scout, Corvette, Interceptor, Fighter) to the battlefield
- Use attack cards generated by your deployed ships
- Manage energy resources each turn
- Defend against enemy attacks by using your ships as shields
- Build and optimize your deck through combat

## Core Mechanics

### Ship Deployment
- Deploy ship cards to the battlefield by dragging them to the play area
- Each deployed ship generates attack cards and provides defensive capabilities
- Ships have armor and shield values that absorb enemy damage

### Ship Abilities
When you play a deployed ship card from your hand, it activates its special ability:
- **Scout, Fighter, Interceptor**: Dodge - Evade enemy attacks this turn
- **Corvette**: Torpedo - Shuffle a powerful 10-damage Torpedo into your deck

### Combat System
- Each turn you have energy to spend on playing cards
- Attack cards trigger animations where ships rotate, fire projectiles, and damage enemies
- Enemy targets deployed ships first, then attacks the player directly
- When a ship is destroyed, all its attack cards are removed from your deck

### Card Types
- **Ship Cards**: Scout, Corvette, Interceptor, Fighter (deploy to battlefield)
- **Attack Cards**: Generated by deployed ships, deal damage to enemies
- **Torpedo**: 10 damage, 1 cost (created by Corvette ability)
- **Shields Up**: Buffs all deployed ships and ships in hand with +1 shield

## Technical Features

### Card System
- Dynamic card generation based on CSV database
- Unique instance IDs for tracking card relationships
- Source ship tracking for attack cards and animations
- Deployed ship state management

### Animation System
- Ship rotation to face target
- Projectile bullet travel from ship to enemy
- Enemy flash effect on impact
- Smooth card drag-and-drop with visual feedback
- Red border highlight when dragging cards to play area
- Tween-based animations for smooth card returns

### Combat Features
- Energy management system
- Priority targeting (deployed ships → player)
- Shield and armor damage calculation
- Attack card removal when ships are destroyed
- Turn-based gameplay with enemy AI

## Ship Database

Ships are defined in `card_database/ship_database.csv` with comprehensive stats including:
- Combat stats (armor, shield, damage, accuracy, evasion)
- Movement and deployment properties
- Projectile types and sizes
- Special abilities and energy requirements
- Faction (player/enemy) and size class designations

## Development

### Requirements
- Godot 4.5 or higher
- GDScript knowledge

### Running the Game
1. Open the project in Godot 4.5+
2. Run the main scene: `scenes/Combat.tscn`
3. Deploy ships and use attack cards to defeat the enemy

### Key Files
- `scripts/Combat_2.gd`: Main combat system (lane-based tactical combat)
- `scripts/DataManager.gd`: Centralized CSV data loading singleton
- `card_database/ship_database.csv`: Ship and enemy definitions

## Game Flow

1. **Start Turn**: Draw cards, gain 3 energy
2. **Deploy Phase**: Drag ship cards to deploy them
3. **Combat Phase**: Use attack cards to damage enemy
4. **End Turn**: Enemy attacks deployed ships or player
5. **Repeat**: Continue until enemy or player is defeated

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Multiple enemy types
- More ship varieties
- Additional card effects
- Deck building between battles
- Roguelike progression system
- Star map navigation integration
- Sound effects and music
